# NOTES
* Obviously **news.qq.com** diverted the data source to somewhere and swung their reporting templates and data structure quite often in the past few weeks, and most of the codes here do not work any more. 
* Need to wedge out some time pieces to cope with the new changes. It seems that the data source from Hopkins University is way better.
* Stuck in North Africa, no time and no Internet for such actions yet. Sorry to the forker(s).
